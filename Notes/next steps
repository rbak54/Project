next steps
read into sensitivity analysis

look into more data for influenza or similar viruses
figure out impossible parameters-perhaps using data??


using these parameters model influenza for different peaks of social contact
Model/simulate/plot	
	R0 over time
	R over time 
	no over time
different levels of mismatch- find a way to quantify differences
sensitivity analysis


find influenza and compare



predict for covid



eventually - humidity
